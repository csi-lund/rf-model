# rf-model
Source types and models for use in the sdk

# proof of concept.
The idea is that using github agents to grab the open api specification the riksf√∂rbundet expose, then to use Gnostic/Gnostic GRPC to create a protofbuf model libary of their APIs.
Since protobuf is language agnostic if we can keep the protobuf models up-to-date they can then be used to create the model/type libraries for several different lanugage SDKs. These can be packages and consumed by projects and SDKs

# The goal 
Is to allow different ogranisations and indiviuals to better integrate with the RF APIs, hopefully creating the possibility for more competition and greater accessibility for sports organisations within Sweden to maintian their organisations without needing expensive private applications. Sport should be accessible for all and organisations should not have bankrupt themselves or transfer the costs to members.
